# Time-series-forecasting-using-ARIMA

Time-series forecasting is a crucial aspect of machine learning that deals with the prediction of future values based on previously observed values. While it is true that the temporal nature of time-series data adds a layer of complexity, the potential applications and impact of accurate forecasting are vast and significant. The challenge lies in the fact that time-series data can exhibit trends, seasonality, and various forms of non-stationarity, which require specialized techniques and a deep understanding of the domain to model effectively.

One of the most widely used methods for time-series forecasting is the ARIMA model, which stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. ARIMA is a statistical approach that models the different components of the time series separately, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the underlying patterns. It combines the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models, as well as differencing operations to achieve stationarity. This makes ARIMA particularly well-suited for non-seasonal time series data where the underlying processes are believed to be stable over time.

However, many real-world time-series datasets exhibit seasonal effects. To address this, the Seasonal ARIMA, or SARIMA, extends the ARIMA model by incorporating an additional set of seasonal terms. These seasonal components help in capturing the regular pattern of change observed at fixed intervals of time and are crucial for accurate forecasting in data with clear periodicity, such as electricity demand, which peaks during certain hours of the day, or retail sales that spike during the holiday season.
